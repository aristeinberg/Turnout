## A note about privacy

The Drive Turnout app runs entirely on your phone - we only track anonymous
usage information. No private information is shared back to our servers. The
app helps facilitate access to your phone's address book, your Facebook
contacts, and the Pennsylvania state-wide system for ballot tracking, but
none of this makes its way to us. We do track the voting status of your
contacts, anonymously, as a way of measuring impact.

As far as the privacy of your contacts from you - all of the information
presented in this app is already available to you publicly, the app merely
serves as a way of helping you keep track of it all in one place.
