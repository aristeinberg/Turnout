## A note about privacy

The Drive Turnout app runs entirely on your phone - we only track anonymous
usage information. No private information is shared back to our servers. The
app helps facilitate access to your address book, your Facebook contacts, and
the Pennsylvania state-wide system for ballot tracking, but none of this
makes its way to us. All of this information is already available to you
publicly, the app merely serves as a way of keeping track of it all in one
place.
