# Drive Turnout

Drive Turnout is now live with a focus on Pennsylvania voters. The app will
help you keep track of all your friends in Pennsylvania to make sure they
vote successfully.

Drive Turnout helps you make sure your friends' votes count. You can use
state-wide web sites to check whether your friends have already voted and, if
so, to make sure that their ballots were processed successfully.

### A note about privacy

The Drive Turnout app runs entirely on your phone - we only track anonymous
usage information. No private information is shared back to our servers. The
app helps facilitate access to your address book, your Facebook contacts, and
the Pennsylvania state-wide system for ballot tracking, but none of this
makes its way to us. All of this information is already available to you
publicly, the app merely serves as a way of keeping track of it all in one
place.
