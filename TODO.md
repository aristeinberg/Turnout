- next steps:
  - [ ] optional push notifications to get updated when there's something important to do
  - [ ] guide the outreach conversation:
    - [ ] when/how do they plan to vote (make sure they don't VBM too late)
    - [ ] do they need any help - link to 866ourvote
    - [ ] would they like to use Turnout? send link
    - [ ] open-ended notes

- polish:
  - [ ] get rid of the remaining "save" buttons - make everything save automatically on update
  - [ ] if they already have a city set up (e.g. from the address book), select county automatically
  - [ ] can move the separator into FlatList instead of in ListButton (so that it isn't replicated at the end of the list)
  - [ ] searchbox at top of address book importer (move to typeahead?)
  - [ ] help figuring out birthdays:
     - [ ] automatically navigate the facebook profile to the basic info section
     - [ ] try to scan your phone calendar for birthdates
  - [ ] help you figure out what county they live in:
     - [ ] show their FB profile to find their city

- bugs:
  - [ ] if i try to auto-submit the PA ballot checker form, for some reason it gets into a refresh loop, so for now auto-submission is disabled.
  - [ ] is the back nav button missing its "<"?
  - [ ] weird scroll bar in the middle of the birthday FB webview
