- [ ] dialog to choose where to import contacts from
  - [ ] manually enter a contact by typing in the info
- [ ] display the time the vote status was last updated
- [ ] track when you last reached out
- [ ] analytics?? would be nice to track impact in some way!

- advanced features:
  - [ ] help you figure out what county they live in, e.g. by entering the city
  - [ ] try to scan your phone calendar for birthdates
  - [ ] figure out other places to import contacts from, e.g. facebook
  - [ ] improved phone address book import that allows you to choose which contacts to import rather than purely relying on PA area codes
  - [ ] scrape the voter info directly off the embedded webview
  - [ ] virality: promote Turnout in the reachouts
  - [ ] suggest multiple variants of reachouts and let the user choose which makes sense

- bugs:
  - [ ] the Picker for vote status needs styling - impossible to read
  - [ ] if i try to auto-submit the PA ballot checker form, for some reason it gets into a refresh loop, so for now auto-submission is disabled.
