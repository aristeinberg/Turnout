- [ ] i think we might need to change how we persist data. at a top level, just store a list of contact ids and then for each contact save its state separately. the upside would be that we can serialize an update to a single contact without updating the entire database each time.
- [ ] dialog to choose where to import contacts from
  - [ ] improved contact import that allows you to choose which contacts to import rather than purely relying on PA area codes
  - [ ] could also import contacts from other places, e.g. facebook
  - [ ] manually enter a contact by typing in the info
- [ ] "action" buttons for each Person are dynamic based on what info we have about the contact
  - [ ] enter/find birthday - need ability to save birthday after updating widget.
    - [ ] try to scan your phone calendar for their birthdate?
  - [ ] enter/find county
    - [ ] if you know what city they live in, we could tell you what county it's in
  - [ ] check voting status
    - [ ] open up https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/BallotTracking.aspx
    - [ ] ideally, we could scrape the info from this page
    - [ ] if scraping is not feasible, guide the user through what they need to enter as best as possible
    - [ ] if scraping is not available, prompt the user to tell us what the vote status they saw was
  - [ ] reach out to the contact
    - [ ] give some suggestions for what to text the person, based on their current vote status
