- next steps:
  - [ ] analytics?? would be nice to track impact in some way!
  - [ ] switch UI to reduce the number of "buttons" and instead more closely resemble the phone contact UI with list items and highlighting on touch
     - [ ] home contact list could show "next steps" rather than listing random details
  - [ ] track facebook login status and present a different url/UI for logging in the first time

- polish:
  - [ ] help you figure out what county they live in:
     - [ ] lookup from a city 
     - [ ] show their FB profile to find their city
     - [ ] check the phone address book for a city/address
  - [ ] help figuring out birthdays:
     - [ ] automatically navigate the facebook profile to the basic info section
     - [ ] try to scan your phone calendar for birthdates
  - [ ] help contacting people
     - [ ] match up facebook contacts with address book entries to find phone number
     - [ ] link/webview to contact on FB messenger
  - [ ] separate out the concept of vote status reported by web site from vote status reported by reaching out
     - [ ] display the time the vote status was last updated
     - [ ] track when you last reached out, take notes on the result and/or update their vote status

- bugs:
  - [ ] the Picker for vote status needs styling - impossible to read
  - [ ] fix styling on webviews to fit more naturally into the page
  - [ ] if i try to auto-submit the PA ballot checker form, for some reason it gets into a refresh loop, so for now auto-submission is disabled.
    - [ ] (probably related), if you change counties on the PA site, it refreshes the webview and undoes your change
  - [ ] is the back nav button missing its "<"?
