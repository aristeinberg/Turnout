- [ ] display the time the vote status was last updated
- [ ] track when you last reached out, take notes on the result and/or update their vote status
- [ ] analytics?? would be nice to track impact in some way!

- advanced features:
  - [ ] help you figure out what county they live in, e.g. by entering the city or showing their FB profile
  - [ ] try to scan your phone calendar for birthdates
  - [ ] scrape the voter info directly off the embedded webview
  - [ ] virality: promote Turnout in the reachouts
  - [ ] suggest multiple variants of reachouts and let the user choose which makes sense

- bugs:
  - [ ] the Picker for vote status needs styling - impossible to read
  - [ ] if i try to auto-submit the PA ballot checker form, for some reason it gets into a refresh loop, so for now auto-submission is disabled.
    - [ ] (probably related), if you change counties on the PA site, it refreshes the webview and undoes your change
